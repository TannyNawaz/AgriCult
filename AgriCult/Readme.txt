Used Application Cache/Web storage for syncing the application with the server database
Used native javascript object called navigator for checking if the browser is online or offline
Tried to use AppFabric but was not able to get the server configured in my local box. However the config in web.config and the code to get the list of Farms is in place in CustomerController
Used web api to sync with the server
I worked on to get only one Form with few fields for Create and Retrieve but the point is, the database is already in place and just a matter of using MVC Scaffolding to create CRUD views and its respective actions.
